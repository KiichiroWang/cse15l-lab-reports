Part 2) Setting Up Visual Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code, go to
https://code.visualstudio.com/
and follow the insturctions respective to your computer (Mac, Windows, etc)

Once installed open it to show a menu similar to this
*put vs code image here*

From here we can move on to connecting to the ieng6 servers once we install git

Part 3) Installing and Settuing up Git Bash

To install git for Windows computers follow
https://gitforwindows.org/

Mac already has a preinstalled system we can use instead of git.

Once installed to begin using Bash on VScode follow these instructions
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994

Perfect, now we can rmeotely connect

Part 4) Connecting Remotely

In the newly opened git bash terminal, enter the line

$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

where the zz is replaced the appropriate letters of your own specific course account.
From there you may get the following message

The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

Say yes and then proceed to enter your password.
WARNING: when you type letters will not appear as it will hide it, YOU ARE TYPING HOWEVER so just keep going
and enter your password

Now hopefully your terminal will look a little like this
